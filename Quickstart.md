- Before deleting projects
- Before closing browser

### Tip 3: Project Organization
```
Format: "ProductName_BoardName_Revision"
Example: "SmartWatch_MainBoard_Rev_C"
```

### Tip 4: KiCad Matching
Ensure BOM designators match schematic references:
```
BOM: R1, R2, C1
KiCad: R1, R2, C1  ‚úÖ
```

### Tip 5: Search Shortcuts
- Part numbers: `"RC0805"`
- Values: `"10k"` or `"0.1uF"`
